Building a website for interaction between the citizens and the government in Ho Chi Minh city

The citizens can send requests about the problems in their lives to the goverment.
The problems may be in many fields such as: Electricity, Water, Environment, Robbery, ... and they will be sent directly to the right departments which take responsibilities for those problems.
The citizens can also keep track the progress of solving those problems and leave feedback about the requests.
